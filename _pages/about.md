Welcome to my personal page! I am a research scientist at [Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alibaba-ntu-jri), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, where I explore the exciting intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine. My research focuses on leveraging advanced AI technologies for disease diagnosis, treatment optimization, and patient monitoring. I have a particular interest in vision-language large models and diffusion models, aiming to push the boundaries of AI applications in healthcare.

Before joining NTU, I worked as an associate researcher at the [HDMI Lab](http://hdmilab.cn/) of Pazhou Lab and South China University of Technology, collaborating with Prof. Xu Yanwu on multi-modal ophthalmic image analysis and technology translation. I also honed my engineering skills as a senior engineer at Baidu. I earned both my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 2015 and 2020, respectively. During my doctoral journey, I conducted research on coronary vascular structure analysis under the mentorship of Prof. Yang Jian at the [Augmented Reality & Intelligent Medicine Lab](https://www.inavilab.com/index).

Feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect and discuss ideas!
